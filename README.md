# SensiML M5StickC-PLUS Unified Arduino Sketch
This repository provides a unified Arduino sketch application to support multiple aspects of developing, testing, and deploying IoT applications using SensiML Analytics Toolkit on the M5StickC PLUS ESP32-PICO Mini IoT Development Kit.  SensiML's tool suite enables users to easily build TinyML sensor recognition models that are small enough to execute entirely on embedded microcontrollers like the ESP32 without any external compute dependencies during ML inferencing.

## M5StickC PLUS ESP32-PICO Mini IoT Development Kit
[M5StickC PLUS](https://shop.m5stack.com/products/m5stickc-plus-esp32-pico-mini-iot-development-kit), manufactured by M5Stack, is powered by the ESP32-PICO-D4 with Wi-Fi and is an upgrade of the original M5StickC with a bigger screen. It's an easy-to-use, open source, IoT development board that is both tiny and feature packed enabling you to realize your smart IoT ideas and speed up your IoT prototyping efforts. As a battery powered, extensible dev kit that integrates an IMU, microphone, buttons, and extensible I/O for external sensors, the M5StickC PLUS makes a great platform for building TinyML models utilizing the SensiML toolkit.
